<p>Commercially, given the extraordinary expanding cultural impact of the "Fast and Furious" series, "The Last Witch Hunter" might expect to ride on Diesel 
fumes to an extent. Yet if its aim is to reposition him as a solo action star, perhaps re-engaging the dwindling audience for the "Riddick" films, this new 
vehicle doesn't really play to his strengths - despite being developed and co-produced by the actor himself. Barring an early (and swiftly discarded) reference 
to his character's prowess as a ladies' man, there's precious little room here for Diesel's lunkish, slightly self-parodic streak of humor. And if it's hard to
 buy the star as a 14th-century soldier of the Catholic Church, earnestly slaying sorceresses for 700 years without a wrinkle to show for it, the screenplay 
 (bearing evident redrafting scars from a trio of scribes) doesn't make much of an effort to sell the idea.For starters, it's uncertain where our noble 
 witch-hunter, Kaulder, actually comes from: Based on scant evidence in the pre-credit prologue, let's say it's 
the little-remembered European land of Snowsylvania, though eight centuries has been long enough for him to adopt Diesel's trademark gravelly drawl. It's 
probably unwise to demand more detailed a milieu from a film that claims the Black Death plague of 1346-53 was in fact foisted upon humanity by a vindictive 
Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht, or what's left of her beneath a maggoty digital mask) bent on total human eradication. Luckily, Kaulder - sporting a braided 
beard and luscious undercut that would not be out of place in contemporary Williamsburg - has our backs, wasting the Queen in a murky introductory battle. Not 
before she afflicts him with the curse of immortality, however, thus consigning him to a lonely life of winnowing out her mangy kind, haunted by the memory of 
his long-perished wife and daughter. He looks good on it, though, even if the on-trend locks are swiftly sacrificed for Diesel's standard minimalist coiffure. 
In present-day Manhattan, he lives in relatively comfortable torment in a plush Upper East Side loft, seducing the occasional air stewardess and accepting 
international witch-hunting assignments from a succession of priestly advisers known as Dolans. The latest of these, Dolan 36th, takes the typically jovial 
form of Michael Caine, whose helpfully explanatory voiceover is unceremoniously dropped shortly after it begins - and shortly before he's dispatched to his 
coffin in mysterious circumstances. Suspecting foul play, specifically of the "fair is foul and foul is fair" variety, Kaulder begins the search for the Weird 
Sister responsible, with Dolan's dormouse-like successor (Elijah Wood, decidedly under-burdened) in tow. From here on, the investigation plays out not unlike 
a super-sized episode of "Murder, She Wrote," only with more shape-shifting ghouls and fire-strewn showdowns between good and evil. He also happens upon a 
spunky good-witch ally in dark-arts club owner Chloe (cannily cast "Games of Thrones" alum Rose Leslie), whose initial surliness and plethora of Hot Topic 
accessories conceal a rare command of "dream-walking," a strain of mind-altering white magic. As they follow the breadcrumb trail around a city that seems 
markedly oblivious to the insect tornadoes and snaking "plague trees" springing up overnight - Pittsburgh fills in unsteadily for the Big Apple, though it's 
not the least credible performance here - it becomes clear that the long-vanquished Queen has returned for another crack at earthly domination. Offering 
audsnary a wink to the dim absurdity of his mission, Diesel trudges dourly through the proceedings, practically expectorating dialogue that is, in fairness, 
pretty hard to play with. ("They took all the most powerful witches in the world and put them in one place," observes one character. "The witch prison," comes 
the memorable response.) Leslie brings glimmers of gumption to her conveniently abled sidekick role; she at least appears to be having more fun than formidable
 thesps like Rena Owen ("Once Were Warriors"), as a stern member of an underground witch-control council, and, most bizarrely, Isaach De Bankole as a blind 
 Ivorian bakery owner and mystic herb merchant named - for reasons of apparent script inflexibility - Max Schlesinger. Perhaps he could have swapped roles with
 Caine, who appears to be doing some less supernatural dream-walking of his own in several scenes. There are certainly enough dopey diversions here for "The 
 Last Witch Hunter" to be considerably more fun than it is, but even its most extravagant bouts of silliness are hampered by desultory plotting and Eisner's 
 oppressively synthetic mise-en-scene. Dean Semler's lensing has a dull slickness that mostly defers to the pic's Marmite-colored morass of visual effects, 
 which are somehow as tawdry-looking as they are conceptually elaborate. The pic's climactic face-off between human and Hexan is a particular letdown, heavily
 recycling both the character conflicts and the cockroach-and-brimstone imagery of the intro; it's hard not to wish that Kaulder had simply done a more 
 thorough job 700 years ago and spared us all the trouble. "Can you feel it - your life, your mortality - ebbing away?" bellows the Queen Witch in her final 
 fight. Whether she's addressing Kaulder or the audience is open to question.</p>
<img src="Images/Spectre.jpg" class="imgright"> 
<p>It may be no coincidence that Agent 007's latest love interest, played by French actress Lea Seydoux in the new James Bond movie "Spectre," is called 
Madeleine Swann, because the film seems like a swan song for some of the participants. Both Daniel Craig, playing Bond for the fourth time in the film screened
 for the press in London on Wednesday, and director Sam Mendes, in his second outing for the now 24-film franchise, have been widely reported as saying they 
 want out. Craig has even gone so far as to say he would rather slit his wrists than play Bond again.In the ways of the movie world and successful franchises -
the last Bond film, "Skyfall", raked in some $1.1 billion at the box office worldwide - all that could change come Bond 25. But this slick but overlong, at well
 over two hours, outing that takes viewers on an armchair journey from Mexico City to London to Rome to Austria to Tunisia and then back to London, has a 
 somewhat tired feel about it, as if it had overgorged on a diet of Aston Martin cars, Omega watches and Belvedere vodka - among the main product placements.
Michael Wilson, a co-producer of the film, said onstage at a central London screening in advance of the British premiere next week that he hoped the press would
tweet opinions, but not spoilers.
The film, though, trumpets roughly within the first half hour -- so no spoiler here -- that the high-rise, high-tech offices of a new uber intelligence agency 
being created in London, which will make double-0 agents like Bond superfluous, has been paid for with private funds -- a heavy hint of what is up.
In other scenes, Mendes and the scriptwriters have had fun, referencing scenes from gangster and crime-steeped films like "The Untouchables" -- for an 
underworld boardroom ghastliness -- to "The Italian Job" where Bond's latest Aston Martin supercar and an Audi replace Minis careening down steps in Rome.
There is a ring which will unite them all, as in "The Lord of the Rings", but saying what it will unite and why -- that would be a spoiler.
That leaves Bond and his villains -- in this case the Austrian Christoph Waltz, reprising a Bond villain of the past -- but there are 23 previous films, so 
that is no spoiler -- and his Bond girls.
There are three, but the only one who makes an impression is Seydoux, who gets a great catwalk moment in the dining car of an "Orient Express"-style train,
 wearing a mostly not-there dress.
Which brings us back to the Seydoux character's name - Madeleine Swann.
This film, with its villain from the past, and Bond rummaging back in time for answers to the film's mysteries, is riffing on the French author Marcel Proust,
 one of whose main characters was Swann and whose memories of childhood were triggered by eating a sweet madeleine cake.
That is no spoiler, but unfortunately it also may be one of the film's best takeaways, and surely literary allusions are not what audiences want from a Bond 
film.
